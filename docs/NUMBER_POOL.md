# Twilio Number Pool Configuration

This feature implements a pool of phone numbers for outgoing calls. Instead of using a single phone number as the caller ID for all outgoing calls, the system randomly selects a number from your Twilio account for each call.

## How It Works

1. When a user initiates a call, the application makes a request to `/api/twilio-numbers` to fetch a random phone number from your Twilio account.

2. The selected number is then used as the caller ID for the outgoing call.

3. This distributes the call volume across multiple phone numbers, which helps to:
   - Prevent any single number from being flagged as spam
   - Improve reliability if a specific number has issues
   - Handle higher call volumes

## Implementation Details

- The number pool is cached for 10 minutes to reduce API calls to Twilio
- If fetching numbers fails, the system falls back to the default caller ID specified in your environment variables
- All active numbers in your Twilio account are included in the pool

## Configuration

No additional configuration is needed. As long as you have:

1. Multiple phone numbers active in your Twilio account
2. The correct Twilio credentials in your environment variables:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
   TWILIO_CALLER_ID=your-default-fallback-number
   ```

The system will automatically use your number pool.

## Monitoring

You can view the active phone numbers in your pool by implementing the `PhoneNumberPool` component in your admin dashboard. This component:

- Shows all active numbers in your Twilio account
- Displays when the list was last refreshed
- Allows manual refreshing of the number list

## Troubleshooting

If calls are not using random numbers:

1. Check your Twilio account to ensure you have multiple active phone numbers
2. Verify your Twilio credentials in the environment variables
3. Look at the server logs to see if there are any errors fetching phone numbers
4. Check the browser console for any client-side errors

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to this feature include:

1. Adding a weighted selection algorithm based on call performance metrics
2. Implementing number rotation strategies (round-robin, time-based, etc.)
3. Adding the ability to exclude specific numbers from the pool
4. Automatic testing of numbers to ensure they're functioning properly
